# THE COMING WAVE - Demo Version

## CHAPTER 1: CONTAINMENT IS NOT POSSIBLE

### THE WAVE

ALMOST EVERY CULTURE HAS A flood myth.

In ancient Hindu texts, the first man in our universe, Manu, is warned of an impending deluge and becomes its sole survivor. The Epic of Gilgamesh records the god Enlil as destroying the world in a giant flood, a story that will resonate with anyone familiar with the Old Testament story of Noah's ark. Plato talked of the lost city of Atlantis, washed away in an immense torrent.

The rise and spread of technologies has also taken the form of world-changing waves. A single overriding trend has stood the test of time since the discovery of fire and stone tools, the first technologies harnessed by our species. Almost every foundational technology ever invented follows a single, seemingly immutable law: it gets cheaper and easier to use, and ultimately it proliferates, far and wide.

This proliferation of technology in waves is the story of Homo technologicus - of the technological animal. Humanity's quest to improve ourselves, our lot, our abilities, and our influence over our environment has powered a relentless evolution of ideas and creation.

### THE DILEMMA

Contemplating the profound power of human intelligence led me to ask a simple question: What if we could distill the essence of what makes us humans so productive and capable into software, into an algorithm? Finding the answer might unlock unimaginably powerful tools to help tackle our most intractable problems.

With this in mind, in a quaint Regency-era office overlooking London's Russell Square, I co-founded a company called DeepMind with two friends, Demis Hassabis and Shane Legg, in the summer of 2010. This was our goal: replicate the very thing that makes us unique as a species, our intelligence.

It certainly felt pretty far-out at the time. Back then, widespread adoption of artificial intelligence was the stuff of daydreams. But, as I write this and think back over the last decade, progress in AI has been nothing short of staggering. DeepMind became one of the world's leading AI companies, achieving a string of breakthroughs.

Today, AI systems can almost perfectly recognize faces and objects. We take speech-to-text transcription and instant language translation for granted. AI can navigate roads and traffic well enough to drive autonomously in some settings. Even in more challenging domains like long-term planning and imagination, progress leaps forward.

## CHAPTER 4: THE TECHNOLOGY OF INTELLIGENCE

### THE BREAKTHROUGH

In 2012, something remarkable happened in AI research. A team led by Geoffrey Hinton demonstrated that deep neural networks could dramatically outperform traditional approaches to image recognition. This breakthrough, known as AlexNet, reduced error rates by more than 40 percent compared to the previous state of the art.

The key was a technique called deep learning - using artificial neural networks with many layers that could learn increasingly abstract representations of data. Given enough data and computing power, these networks could teach themselves to recognize patterns with unprecedented accuracy.

This wasn't just an incremental improvement. It represented a fundamental shift in how AI systems could learn. Rather than being programmed with explicit rules, they could extract their own rules from vast amounts of data. The implications were profound and immediate.

### SCALING UP

Over the following years, researchers discovered something unexpected: these models got better the bigger they became. More parameters, more data, and more computing power consistently led to better performance. This scaling law has driven explosive progress in AI capabilities.

By 2020, models like GPT-3 contained 175 billion parameters and were trained on hundreds of billions of words. They could write coherent essays, answer questions, and even write computer code. The pace of improvement shocked even researchers in the field.

In 2023, models like GPT-4 demonstrated near-human performance across a wide range of cognitive tasks. They could pass professional exams, engage in complex reasoning, and produce creative works of remarkable sophistication. What had seemed impossible just a decade earlier was now routine.

## CHAPTER 13: CONTAINMENT MUST BE POSSIBLE

### THE CHALLENGE

The coming wave presents humanity with an unprecedented challenge. We must find ways to harness the benefits of transformative technologies while managing their risks. This is not optional - the future of civilization may depend on getting this right.

Containment doesn't mean stopping progress. It means ensuring that powerful technologies remain under meaningful human control and are directed toward beneficial outcomes. It means building robust safeguards, oversight mechanisms, and governance frameworks that can adapt as capabilities grow.

The good news is that containment is still possible, but only if we act now. Every month that passes without serious action makes the challenge harder. We need coordinated efforts across government, industry, academia, and civil society.

### A PATH FORWARD

Containment requires action at multiple levels. At the technical level, we need AI systems designed with safety as a priority. At the institutional level, we need new forms of oversight and accountability. At the international level, we need cooperation and agreements that span borders.

This won't be easy. The incentives pushing toward rapid development are powerful. National security concerns, commercial competition, and scientific ambition all drive the wave forward. But history shows that when humanity faces existential challenges, we can rise to meet them.

The question is whether we will act in time. The wave is building. How we respond in the coming years will shape the trajectory of human civilization for generations to come. We cannot afford to fail.
