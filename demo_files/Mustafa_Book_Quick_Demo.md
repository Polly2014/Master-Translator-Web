## CHAPTER 1: CONTAINMENT IS NOT POSSIBLE

### THE WAVE

ALMOST EVERY CULTURE HAS A flood myth. In ancient Hindu texts, the first man in our universe, Manu, is warned of an impending deluge and becomes its sole survivor. The Epic of Gilgamesh records the god Enlil as destroying the world in a giant flood, a story that will resonate with anyone familiar with the Old Testament story of Noah's ark.

The rise and spread of technologies has also taken the form of world-changing waves. A single overriding trend has stood the test of time since the discovery of fire and stone tools: almost every foundational technology ever invented follows a single law - it gets cheaper, easier to use, and ultimately proliferates far and wide.

This proliferation of technology in waves is the story of Homo technologicus - the technological animal. Humanity's quest to improve ourselves and our influence over our environment has powered a relentless evolution of ideas and creation.
