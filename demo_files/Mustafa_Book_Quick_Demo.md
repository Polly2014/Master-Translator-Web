# THE COMING WAVE - Ultra Quick Demo

## CHAPTER 1: THE WAVE

ALMOST EVERY CULTURE HAS A flood myth. In ancient texts, Manu is warned of an impending deluge. The Epic of Gilgamesh records the god Enlil as destroying the world in a giant flood.

The rise of technologies has taken the form of world-changing waves. Almost every foundational technology follows a single law: it gets cheaper, easier to use, and proliferates far and wide.

## CHAPTER 2: THE BREAKTHROUGH

In 2012, something remarkable happened in AI research. Geoffrey Hinton demonstrated that deep neural networks could dramatically outperform traditional approaches. This breakthrough reduced error rates by more than 40 percent.

The key was deep learning - using artificial neural networks with many layers. Given enough data and computing power, these networks could teach themselves to recognize patterns with unprecedented accuracy.

## CHAPTER 3: THE CHALLENGE

The coming wave presents humanity with an unprecedented challenge. We must harness the benefits of transformative technologies while managing their risks. The future of civilization may depend on getting this right.

Containment means ensuring that powerful technologies remain under meaningful human control. We need robust safeguards, oversight mechanisms, and governance frameworks. The good news is that containment is still possible, but only if we act now.
